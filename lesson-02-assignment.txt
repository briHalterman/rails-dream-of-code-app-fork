Question 1

spring2026 = Trimester.create(year: '2026', term: 'Spring', application_deadline: '2026-01-15', start_date: "2026-03-01", end_date: "2026-06-30")
CodingClass.all.each do | cc |
  Course.create(coding_class_id: cc.id, trimester_id: spring2026.id, max_enrollment: 30)
end

Question 2

intro_class = CodingClass.find_by(title: "Intro to Programming")
course = Course.find_by(trimester_id: spring2026.id, coding_class_id: intro_class.id);
new_student = Student.create(first_name: 'Colby', last_name: 'Johnson', email: 'colby.jack@test.com')
enrollment = Enrollment.create(course_id: course.id, student_id: new_student.id)

available_mentor_id = MentorEnrollmentAssignment.joins(:mentor).group(:mentor_id).having('COUNT(mentor_id) <= 2').pluck(:mentor_id).first
available_mentor = Mentor.find_by(id: available_mentor_id)
:MentorEnrollmentAssignment.create(mentor_id: available_mentor.id, enrollment_id: enrollment.id)

Question 3

I want to build a personalized flashcard app to help students actively study and retain information.
Any user who is studying can fill out a form to create a new flashcard. Each card can include a term,
definition, course, topic, and keyword(s). Users can then generate custom decks from their cards based
on any of those characteristics, such as a deck for all cards in the course Intro to Programming, or
all cards tagged with the keyword dinosaurs.

Once a deck is created, flashcards will display one at a time. Users can flip the card to view the definition,
move the card to the back of the deck for further review, or remove it from the deck if they've mastered it.

I can think of a few ways I could build this out beyond the MVP. It would be great to be able to save
decks (with removed cards replaced). Another useful feature could be a glossary that gets created to go
along with each deck for an easy reference of the terms and definitions. The ability to add an image to
a flashcard could be really useful.

Question 4

I believe I still have some work to do creating join tables.
