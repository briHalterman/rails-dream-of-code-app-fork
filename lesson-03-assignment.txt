1. What tables do you need to add? Decide on table names and their associations to each other and any existing tables/models.

  The two new tables will be a `topics` table to store topic names and a `lesson-topics` join table to support a many-to-many relationship between lessons and topics.

  class Lesson < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :lesson_topics
    has_many :topics, through: :lesson_topics
  end

  class Topic < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :lesson_topics
    has_many :lessons, through: :lesson_topics
  end

  class LessonTopic < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :lesson
    belongs_to :topic
  end

  Note: Lessons are already associated with courses. The relationship with topics allows lessons to be categorized across different courses.

2. What columns are necessary for the associations you decided on?

  topics:
  name        string

  lesson_topics:
  lesson_id   foreign key to lessons table
  topic_id    foreign key to topics table

3. What other columns (if any) need to be included on the tables? What other data needs to be stored?

  Both tables will also include auto-generated primary key IDs and  the rails timestamps, created_at and updated_at.

4. Write out each table's name and column names with data types.

  topics:
  id          integer
  name        string
  created_at  datetime
  updated_at  datetime

  lesson_topics:
  id          integer
  lesson_id   integer
  topic_id    integer
  created_at  datetime
  updated_at  datetime

5. Determine the generator command you'll need to create the migration file and run the command to generate the empty migration file. Start with just the topics migration. (Hint: your filename should be create_topics)

  bin/rails generate migration create_topics
